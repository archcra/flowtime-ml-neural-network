<p>
Neural networks (NNs) were originally motivated by looking at machines which replicate the brain's functionality.

<p>
  NNs are computationally expensive, so only recently large scale neural networks became computationally feasible

  Hypothesis is that the brain has a single learning algorithm

Evidence for hypothesis
1. Auditory cortex --> takes sound signals
    If you cut the wiring from the ear to the auditory cortex
    Re-route optic nerve to the auditory cortex
    Auditory cortex learns to see


2. Haptic belt direction sense
    Belt which buzzes towards north
    Gives you a sense of direction


Brain can process and learn from data from any source
