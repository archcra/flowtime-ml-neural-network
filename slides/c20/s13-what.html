 </a></h1>
<pre style="font-size:1.2em;">Hypothesis is that the brain has a single
  learning algorithm

Evidence for hypothesis
1. Auditory cortex --> takes sound signals
    If you cut the wiring from the ear to the auditory
        cortex
    Re-route optic nerve to the auditory cortex
    Auditory cortex learns to see

2. Haptic belt direction sense
    Belt which buzzes towards north
    Gives you a sense of direction
