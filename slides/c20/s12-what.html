<p style="margin-top: -2em; ">
  Neuroscientists have done the
   following fascinating experiments where
   you cut the wire from
   the ears to the auditory
   cortex and you re-wire,

  in this case an animal's brain, so
   that the signal from the eyes
   to the optic nerve eventually gets routed to the auditory cortex.

  If you do this it turns out,
   the auditory cortex will learn

  to see.
   And this is in every single sense
   of the word see as we know it.
   So, if you do this to the animals,
   the animals can perform visual discrimination
   task and as they can
   look at images and make appropriate
   decisions based on the
   images and they're doing
   it with that piece of brain tissue.
