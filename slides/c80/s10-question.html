<p>
The term deep neural nets refers to any neural network with several hidden layers. Convolutional neural nets are a specific type of deep neural net which are especially useful for image recognition. Specifically, convolutional neural nets use convolutional and pooling layers, which reflect the translation-invariant nature of most images. For your problem, CNNs would work better than generic DNNs since they implicitly capture the structure of images.

<p>
You can use either a generic DNN or a CNN, but a CNN will almost certainly give you better results. You should start out with implementing a DNN though, since it's easier and you'll gain some knowledge and intuition about neural networks.
