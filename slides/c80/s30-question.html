<pre>

It depends on what features you think you are looking for. Consider the following networks:

    A) LSTM
    B) Stack a few CNN layers and then global pool (max or average)
    C) DNN on each input in N and then global average or max pool at some point (this is effectively a CNN with a receptive field of 1)
    D) Just a straight DNN

And the situations you might use them:

    A) If the predictive features have long range dependencies (e.g. nlp tasks) then a LSTM or stacked LSTM will capture that.

    B) If the predictive features fit within a window (e.g. does this audio sample contain any bird chirps?) then a CNN should work well.

    C) If you just want to take the max response from each point in time then a DNN on each input in N could work.

    D) A DNN which takes the whole input would require the timeseries to be of a fixed length (N is known). This is probably not efficient for anything but short sequences, and removes translation invariance in time.
