<pre style="font-size: 0.8em; margin-top: -2em;"> Here, input is x1, x2 and x3
  ai(j) - activation of unit i in layer j

  So, a12 - is the activation of the 1st unit in the second layer
  By activation, we mean the value which is computed and output by that node

Ɵ(j) - matrix of parameters controlling the function mapping from layer j to
     layer j + 1
  Parameters for controlling mapping from one layer to the next
  If network has
      sj units in layer j and
      sj+1 units in layer j + 1
      Then Ɵj will be of dimensions [sj+1 , sj + 1]
          Because
            sj+1 is equal to the number of units in layer (j + 1)
            is equal to the number of units in layer j, plus an additional unit
  Looking at the Ɵ matrix
      Column length is the number of units in the following layer
      Row length is the number of units in the current layer + 1 (because we have to map the bias unit)
      So, if we had two layers - 101 and 21 units in each
          Then Ɵj would be = [21 , 102]

What are the computations which occur?

  We have to calculate the activation for each node
  That activation depends on
      The input(s) to the node
      The parameter associated with that node (from the Ɵ vector associated with that layer)
