<p>
  A deep neural network (DNN) is an artificial neural network (ANN) with multiple hidden layers between the input and output layers.DNNs can model complex non-linear relationships. DNN architectures generate compositional models where the object is expressed as a layered composition of primitives.The extra layers enable composition of features from lower layers, potentially modeling complex data with fewer units than a similarly performing shallow network.

Deep architectures include many variants of a few basic approaches. Each architecture has found success in specific domains. It is not always possible to compare the performance of multiple architectures, unless they have been evaluated on the same data sets.

DNNs are typically feedforward networks in which data flows from the input layer to the output layer without looping back.
