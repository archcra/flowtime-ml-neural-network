<p>
  Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), in which data can flow in any direction, are used for applications such as language modeling. Long short-term memory is particularly effective for this use.

  Convolutional deep neural networks (CNNs) are used in computer vision.CNNs also have been applied to acoustic modeling for automatic speech recognition (ASR).
